For the demonstrator run in this directory:

./cmssw_oc_server.sh > serverlog.txt &
#wait until the server has started
sleep 30
./cmssw_oc_forward_client.sh <pipe name>

The forward client exposes 2 named pipes (as fifos): <pipe name> and <pipe name>_pred.
The input for the model should be written to <pipe name> and the output can be read from <pipe name>_pred.
